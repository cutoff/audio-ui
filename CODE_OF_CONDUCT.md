# Community Standards

We keep it simple:

1. **Be respectful.** Treat everyone with professional courtesy. We're a community of developers, designers, and audio enthusiasts.
2. **Be helpful.** Share knowledge and provide context (code, versions, frameworks) when asking for or giving support.
3. **Stay on topic.** This space is for AudioUI, audio/MIDI development, and related technical topics.
4. **Use common sense.** If it feels like spam, harassment, or off-topic noise, it probably is.

For real-time discussions and support, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7RB6t2xqYW). Detailed channel guidelines are available in the `#rules` channel.
